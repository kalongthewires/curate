My wife’s parents travel in a zig-zag, stopping at food stalls, artist’s homes, acquaintance’s houses, doubling our travel time. It has, on many occasions, driven me to extreme irritation in my desire to rush from point A to B. But traveling in the states, on highways with only McDonald’s within easy reach, I think that I could do better at making the journey worthwhile.
