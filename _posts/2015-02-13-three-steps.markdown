> "So, if you want to do something different, here's what you have to do, in three steps: 1) you have to value, support and celebrate your learning and creativity on your own, and 2) you have to let go of the notion of linear, finite journeys, and 3) you have to find whatever ways you can to do what you believe in, and keep doing them until you can make your own place."
