1. Build the social media you'd like to see in the world.

2. Hold yourself to intelligent contributions, but

3. Never hesitate to post videos of sloths, cats, puppies.

4. Do post content that will improve worldwide peace or contribute to universal happiness.

5. Share unto others as you would have them share unto you.

6. Keep public ranting and whining to a minimum. If overwhelmed by an urge to spread your angst, [take a deep breath]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWM2joNb9NE").

7. Embrace _private_ ranting and whining without shame.

8. Strive for authenticity. Refrain from condescension and parading around your ego (we know you're fabulous).

9. Document the interesting, the beautiful, and the creative.

10. Avoid the band-wagon. Examine different perspectives.

11. Reflect. Consider your private and your public persona.
